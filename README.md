# Sharingan-AI
This project, Sharingan AI, is a real-time computer vision application that transforms your eyes into the iconic Sharingan from Naruto. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, it tracks your face through the webcam and dynamically animates glowing Sharingan pupils that follow your head movements.
